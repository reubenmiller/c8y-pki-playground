Go EST Client
==========
[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/thales-e-security/estclient?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/thales-e-security/estclient)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thales-e-security/estclient.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thales-e-security/estclient)

A minimal EST client SDK, written in Go (see [RFC 7030](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7030)). 

Support is provided for calling the EST endpoints:
- `/.well-known/est/cacerts`
- `/.well-known/est/simpleenroll`
- `/.well-known/est/simplereenroll`

Enrollment functions support HTTP basic authentication and/or mutual TLS with a previously issued certificate. Check
what your server is expecting.  

## Examples

See `examples/examples.go` for an example that uses the test server at http://www.testrfc7030.com.
o
To execute the example script, run `go run examples/examples.go`. Read on for a description of the code.

### Get the EST certificates

```go
client := estclient.NewEstClient("testrfc7030.com:8443")

cacerts, err := client.CaCerts()
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

fmt.Printf("EST Root Cert: %+v\n", cacerts.EstTA.Subject)
fmt.Printf("Old EST Root Cert: %+v\n", cacerts.OldWithOld)
fmt.Printf("Old Cert Signed By New Key: %+v\n", cacerts.OldWithNew)
fmt.Printf("New Cert Signed By Old Key: %+v\n", cacerts.NewWithOld)
fmt.Printf("Other chain certs: %+v\n", cacerts.EstChainCerts)
```

The `EstTA` cert is the root of trust for all certificates issued by the EST CA. The EST CA may be a subordinate of
this trust anchor, in which case `EstChainCerts` should contain the necessary intermediate certificates to validate
certificates issued by that EST CA.

If the root of trust has been renewed, there may be cross-signed certificates returned in `OldWithOld`, `OldWithNew`
and `NewWithOld`.

### Request a certificate

```go
// Create key and certificate request
key, err := rsa.GenerateKey(rand.Reader, 2048)
panicOnError(err)

template := x509.CertificateRequest{Subject: pkix.Name{CommonName: "Test"}}

reqBytes, err := x509.CreateCertificateRequest(rand.Reader, &template, key)
panicOnError(err)

req, err := x509.ParseCertificateRequest(reqBytes)
panicOnError(err)

// Enroll with EST CA
authData := estclient.AuthData{ID: &id, Secret: &secret}
cert, err := client.SimpleEnroll(authData, req)
panicOnError(err)
fmt.Printf("Initial cert (DER): %x\n", cert.Raw)
```

### Renew a certificate

This client assumes mutual TLS will be required, using the previously issued key and certificate. Additional HTTP
authentication (with an id and secret) is optional. Pass `nil` if these values are not required by the server.


```go
// Re-enroll with EST CA
authData = estclient.AuthData{ID: &id, Secret: &secret, Key: key, ClientCert: cert}
cert2, err := client.SimpleReenroll(authData, req)
panicOnError(err)
fmt.Printf("Renewed cert (DER): %x\n", cert2.Raw)
```

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Please ensure you add tests for new functionality and consider opening an issue
to discuss larger changes before beginning.

When developing, you can disable integration tests (which hit `testrfc7030.com:8443`) by running 
`go test -short ./...`.

| MUST     | After out-of-band validation occurs, all the other certificates MUST be validated using normal [RFC5280] certificate path validation (using the most recent CA certificate as the TA) before they can be used to build certificate paths during certificate validation.                                                                                                                                                       | n/a  |                                                                                                          | 
| MUST     | If the key can be used to generate digital signatures but the requested CSR KeyUsage extension prohibits generation of digital signatures, then the CSR signature MAY still be generated using the private key, but the key MUST NOT be used for any other signature operations (this is consistent with the recommendations concerning submission of proof-of-possession to an RA or CA as described in [SP-800-57-Part-1]). | n/a  | This is surely outside the scope of what the EST client can enforce.                                     |

| MUST     | If the client desires to receive the private key with encryption that exists outside of and in addition to that of the TLS transport used by EST or if server policy requires that the key be delivered in such a form, the client MUST include an attribute in the CSR indicating the encryption key to be used.                                                                                                             | n/a  |                                                                                                          |
